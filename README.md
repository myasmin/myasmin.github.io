- 👋 Hi, I’m @myasmin
- 👀 I’m interested in Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modelling. I work with Data Modelling, e.g. Statistical and Machine Learning Models.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects written in Python and R, and just enough of SQL to pull Data for my Analysis. (I mostly used R, so trying my best to learn with Python just as I know about R). 
- I am working on to get my DP100- Microsoft Azure Data Sceintist Associate Exam. I intend to upload some of my project works in here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. Some of the Datasets make sense and some of them don't. So, I think it's fun to try to find out which is the best way to work for future prediction.
- ❤️ I love reading books, photography and spending time with my two kids!
