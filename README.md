- 👋 Hi, I’m @myasmin
- 👀 I’m interested in Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modelling. I work with Data Modelling, Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis and Statistical / Machine Learning Model development.
- 🌱 I’m fluent with Python and R, intermediate SQL, and Tableau / PowerBI for my Analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. Some of the Datasets make sense and some of them don't. So, I think it's fun to try to find out which is the best way to work for future prediction.
- ❤️ I love reading books, photography and spending time with my two kids!
