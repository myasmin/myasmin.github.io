- 👋 Hi, I’m @myasmin
- 👀 I’m interested in Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modelling. I work with Data Modelling, e.g. Statistical and Machine Learning Models.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects written in Python and R, and just enough of SQL to pull Data for my Analysis. 
- Currently, I am working on to get my DP100- Microsoft Azure Data Sceintist Associate Exam. Thay is why I intend to upload some of my project works in Azure ML Studio and Designer in here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. Some of the Datasets make sense and some of them don't. So, I think it's fun to try to find out which is the best way to work for future prediction.
- ❤️ I love reading books, photography and spending time with my two kids!
